So [Mike](http://screenflicker.com/mike/computers/10-or-so-mac-apps/) has called me out and here it is. We pretty much have the same app taste.

  * [Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/)
  * [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/)
  * [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/)
  * [iChat](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat/) (with [Chax](http://www.ksuther.com/chax/))
  * [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/)
  * [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
  * [Xcode & Interface Builder](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/xcode/) (We&#8217;ll count that as one.)
  * [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html)
  * [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/)
  * [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/)

There are some more that I don&#8217;t really like to mention. Like, [LispWorks](http://www.lispworks.com/) (for work) and [Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/word2004/word2004.aspx?pid=word2004) (for school). I think a more interesting list would be the apps in the 10th through the 20th place. Definitely one of those would be [Webnote Happy Lite](http://www.happyapps.com/webnotehappy/). I&#8217;m starting to use it to store the links I want to eventually get back to. Give it a try.
