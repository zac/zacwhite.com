I created an open source project for [iPhoneDevCamp 2](http://iphonedevcamp.org/). It allows _cross application copy and paste_.

Basically, all you have to do to get the benefits is include a few classes and use the very simple API to copy data or paste data. The special part is cross application. Copy a cocktail in [Cocktails](http://cocktails.cocktaildb.com/) and paste it into [MagicPad](http://magicpad.proximi.com/) ([Video](http://www.viddler.com/explore/mager/videos/36/) of this in action).

There are some limitations. This _technically complies with all Apple agreements_. It is completely possible that apps that use this wouldn&#8217;t get on the App Store. Not for any real reason other than it will eventually step on Apple&#8217;s toes. It is also conceivable that the technology this is built on will break in the future. The hope is that the update that breaks this also brings copy and paste support. ðŸ™‚

**Update:** Ok people. Go download the code at <http://code.google.com/p/touchclipboard/>. Willing to hear name ideas ðŸ™‚
