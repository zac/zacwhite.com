A [couple](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/01/29/tinkerers-sunset) of [people](http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html) have complained that a more consumer electronics based computing platform would be murder to the subculture that they belong to.

From al3x.net:

> The thing that bothers me most about the iPad is this: if I had an iPad rather than a real computer as a kid, I’d never be a programmer today. I’d never have had the ability to run whatever stupid, potentially harmful, hugely educational programs I could download or write. I wouldn’t have been able to fire up ResEdit and edit out the Mac startup sound so I could tinker on the computer at all hours without waking my parents. The iPad may be a boon to traditional eduction, insofar as it allows for multimedia textbooks and such, but in its current form, it’s a detriment to the sort of hacker culture that has propelled the digital economy.

I&#8217;m a fairly young person, yet I realize these sentiments are shared in **every** generation. &#8220;My kids won&#8217;t have the same great experiences I had because of this new technology. They won&#8217;t know the joy of riding a horse on the open range because of this newfangled mechanical carriage!&#8221;

Your kids are going to have the wonderful experience of opening up an interactive textbook on their iPad and learning about how their cells work. Or tapping on a circuit design simulation application and dragging components into a circuit to create a ripple adder. Or posting to their virtual reality homebase that because of the new GenomeEditor 3000 (with presets!!), their kids aren&#8217;t going to have the fun of tinkering with their genome. So the &#8220;think of the children!&#8221; argument isn&#8217;t going to sway me. You can leave those up to [Fox News](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-january-5-2010/even-better-than-the-real-thing).

The new paradigm of a simplified, consumer electronics computing experience isn&#8217;t going to catch on overnight. Look on the bright side though. By the time the only computers left are the ones abstracted away enough to where you can&#8217;t edit the startup sound, we&#8217;ll be retired or, fingers crossed, dead.
