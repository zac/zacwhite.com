In case anyone is interested, I did a poster for the WWDC scientific poster session on the Mac based rover I worked on. Maybe we&#8217;ll get written up on the Apple webpage, or get into the newsletter! That would be cool. Apple is eventually going to put up PDFs of the posters, but until then, here it is all zipped up.
