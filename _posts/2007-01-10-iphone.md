Absolutely awesome. I was thinking about all the product announcements I have seen from Apple and what my reactions to them were. They would come out with a Mac and my reaction would be something like &#8220;Oh man, that would be nice to have! I wish I had the money for that.&#8221; But this is different. I _really_ want this thing&#8230;

Here is my only beef.

I CAN&#8217;T WRITE APPS FOR IT!!!

I have a billion and a half ideas for this thing and it is closed. Why would &#8220;Apple Inc.&#8221; do that? It seems that they could sell a lot more units if we could make totally amazing software for it. No doubt that if they opened it, it would have a bunch of crap applications on it&#8230;but that isn&#8217;t a reason to close it. Maybe they are afraid of some kind of Skype or Gizmo that would screw with their deal with Cingular. But you have to buy 2 years anyway so I don&#8217;t understand. People at least want games for this, but Apple doesn&#8217;t even have those&#8230;
