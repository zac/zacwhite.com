I have been waiting to buy an eBook reader in anticipation of the iPad, so one of the most interesting apps to me is iBooks.

My predictions for iBooks:

  1. There will be an iPhone version.
  2. You will be able to drop in your own books.

#### There will be an iPhone version.

This one seems like a no brainer, yet no one has mentioned it. If you want a successful books store, distribute your portal to as many customers as you can. 30,000,000 people is a good starting point. By decoupling the iBooks store from the system software on the iPad, they are free to produce a truly universal binary that contains an iPhone version and an iPad version.

#### You will be able to drop in your own books.

Apple allows iPad apps to put documents in a certain directory which will be mounted on your computer when the iPad is plugged in. I&#8217;m predicting that all the books will go in there. The books bought from Apple will be DRM protected, but iBooks will work with any ePub book without DRM.

We&#8217;ll know more in 44 days. Do I really have to wait?
